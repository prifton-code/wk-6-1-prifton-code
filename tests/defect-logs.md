## 🧠 Notes
- Payment and validation flows require stricter input handling (postal code, email).  
- Accessibility: Add missing ARIA roles and screen reader labels in Navbar and Checkout steps.  
- Performance: Implement debounce for Navbar search input.  
- UI: Fix mobile alignment for cart icon and badge.  
- Routing: Prevent direct navigation to Checkout when cart is empty.
